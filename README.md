# Intro To Git - A Learnable Course

This is my Git-r-Done project repository for the [Introduction to Git]( https://www.sitepoint.com/premium/courses/introduction-to-git-2902) course I'm taking from Learnable at  SitePoint.

I finished this course. It has been a great learning experience and gave a good foothold to using Git and GitHub in my daily work flow.

## Getting Started With Git

If you don't have a clue how Git and GitHub can work for you, this course will get you going on the path to setting up a great work flow. It's far easier than one would think.

## Changes I have made to improve my work flow

I have been working with web technologies since 1997. Keeping track of all the site changes and having back up folders 20 + deep for all of numerous projects has been a daunting experience to say the least.

I can't believe I waited so long to get my feet wet with Git and GitHub. Mostly, I didn't want to take the time to learn yet another skill. Had I taken time to learn Git, it would have saved me that time a 100 fold in my work flow.

Learning Git was far simpler than nearly any of the languages or frameworks I have learned to date. Guess I'm just a knucklehead from the school of hard knocks.   

Do yourself a favor and learn Git! The sooner the better. Go here and [git-r-done]( https://www.sitepoint.com/premium/courses/introduction-to-git-2902).
